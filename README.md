    Scenario Analysis for {sheet_name}:

    Base Case (3% growth): 
    - The company operates in a challenging environment, with a potential US recession looming and political instability (e.g., US President Trump).
    - The US dollar's gradual decline as the world's reserve currency could impact international revenue. 
    - The risk of inflation and higher borrowing costs due to rising US debt levels would likely squeeze profit margins.
    - Supply chain disruptions from geopolitical tensions (e.g., the Israeli conflict and shifts in trade dynamics) may affect the company's ability to operate smoothly.
    - This scenario assumes moderate growth as the company adapts, but still faces limitations due to a potentially weaker global economy and internal inefficiencies.
    
    Justification: 
    {justification}

    Best Case (5% growth): 
    - Despite the challenges, the company finds opportunities to expand within the US, benefiting from the political climate under President Trump (e.g., potential tax cuts, deregulation).
    - The company moves its operations back to the US, reducing supply chain risks and possibly lowering costs through localized production.
    - In this scenario, the company manages to capitalize on regional growth opportunities, investing in infrastructure, and responding to geopolitical shifts with strategic resilience.
    - An expanding market in the US could offset some of the global economic risks, providing a positive financial outlook.
    
    Worst Case (1% growth): 
    - Geopolitical tensions (e.g., the Israeli war) could disrupt the global supply chain, significantly impacting the companyâ€™s ability to source materials and deliver products efficiently.
    - The threat of an economic recession and continued political uncertainty (US dollar decline, rising debt levels) could lead to reduced consumer demand and tighter credit conditions.
    - The company might struggle to adapt to these global shifts, resulting in severely reduced growth or even operational challenges.
    - In this worst-case scenario, the company faces operational shutdowns, supply shortages, and significant delays in expansion plans.
